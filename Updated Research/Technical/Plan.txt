1. Find emails dataset
2. Recreate same variables as in the source study using Python (get word frequencies from textual data etc.)
3. Check validity of the variables (maybe add new ones, that are sensible)
4. Find stats packages that can be used to run same models
5. Recreate models using the same variables / updated variables
6. Write final report


Further steps:

1) For initial dataset but translated in python perform Hosmer Lemershow and Osius-Rojek tests + some Rsquared such as McKelvey - Zavoina, count, adjusted count

Osius-Rojek were not reporduced

2) Copy the codes to the new dataset with old keywords
3) Copy the codes to the new dataset with new keywords



4) Write the analysis and comparison (report)


5) Make codes looks good and comment them

Add text with the sources and chat GPT
Write a readme
